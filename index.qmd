# Welcome

-   Welcome to the R workshop for Bioscience!
-   The workshop is intended for any Bioscience researchers with limited prior experience in R who is interested in learning how to use R to do data wrangling, data visualization, common statistical analyses.
-   Workshop materials in the github repository [Rworkshop](https://github.com/Kuan-Liu/Rworkshop)

# Learning objectives

At the end of the class, students will be able to:

-   navigate R and R studio interface
-   set up project and coding environment for data analysis
-   efficiently handle datasets
-   perform common data visualizations used in Bioscience
-   conduct descriptive analysis in R
-   conduct regression analysis in R (if time permits)
